# codequiz
When someone takes this code quiz they will click the start button then a timer starts and they are presented with a question. 

When they answer the question they are presented with another question. When they answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.

The game ends when the time reaches zero or all questions are answered.

The final screen allows the player to enter initials and save the score.
